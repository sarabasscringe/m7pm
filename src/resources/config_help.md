# config docs, sort of??
not really nescessary because there are commands for it, might be useful though.
the config.txt is parsed as a command (read help.txt, dont use \n unless intentional), and isnt very readable.
to my defense, it isnt supposed to be read at all

## heres a neat list of what the args does:
1. your operating system (w / lx)
2. wether config should update between every command (y / n)
