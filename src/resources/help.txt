this is the help textfile for m7pm
heads up; each line can only take 8 args of 64 chars each because C is a strict dommy mommy
heres a list of valid commands and usage:
- lping         | basic local ping, prints back a pong
- help          | print a list of commands
- pwd           | print current working directory
- cd            | <target_dir> change wd
- ls            | <w/lx> windows / linux. leave argument empty for the slower custom ls function
